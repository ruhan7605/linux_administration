Automount (AutoFS) NFS share using autofs in Linux:
===========================================
Autofs is a service in Linux like operating system which automatically mounts the file system and remote shares when it is accessed. 
Main advantage of autofs is that you donâ€™t need to mount file system at all time, file system is only mounted when it is in demand.

Server Configuration (192.168.1.109):
------------------------------------------------------------
# yum repolist
Configure YUM in RHEL 7:
please configure the YUM local repository at first. 

# yum install -y nfs*

# mkdir /public

# mkdir /private

# chmod 777 /public

# touch /public/calpublic.txt

# chmod 777 /private

# touch /private/calprivate.txt

# vim /etc/exports
/public 192.168.1.110(ro,sync)
/private 192.168.1.110(rw,sync)

# exportfs -arvf

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd

# firewall-cmd --reload

# systemctl start nfs-server

# systemctl enable nfs-server

# systemctl status nfs-server

# systemctl start rpcbind

# systemctl enable rpcbind

------------------------------------------
Client Configuration (192.168.1.110):

# yum repolist

# yum install autofs -y

# rpm -qi autofs

# mkdir /automount

# mkdir -p /automount/private

# mkdir -p /automount/public

# vim /etc/auto.master
/automount /etc/automount.txt  --timeout=60

# vim /etc/automount.txt
public -ro,sync 192.168.1.109:/public
private  -rw,sync  192.168.1.109:/private

# systemctl start autofs

# systemctl enable autofs

# systemctl status autofs

# systemctl start rpcbind

# systemctl enable rpcbind

----------------------------------
Test AutoFS: 

Login on Client Machine and check the mount point details, here you won't see any NFS Share.

# df -hT

# cd /automount/

# cd private

Again Check the mount point details, here you will see the private NFS Share.
# df -hT

# cd .. ; cd public

Again Check the mount point details, here you will see the public NFS Share.
# df -hT

Now go inside both the directories one by one & try to create and remove some files, here you will find that only RW filesystem allows you to do that not the RO Filesystem.

Now come out of NFS Shares and wait for more than one min, again \ Check the mount point details, here you won't see any NFS Share.
Beacuse both NFS shares got unmounted automatically themself due to AutoFS Service.

You are done.
